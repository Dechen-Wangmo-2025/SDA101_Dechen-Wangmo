This project showcases the process of designing a user interface in Figma, starting from wireframing to high-fidelity design and interactive prototyping. The focus was on building a clean, user-friendly interface while practicing essential Figma skills, including drop-down menus, components, auto layout, responsive designs, and prototyping.

Key Features:
Wireframing: Created low-fidelity wireframes to plan the structure, layout, and navigation of the interface before designing the final look. Wireframes helped visualize the user journey and identify potential issues early.
Creating Design: Developed high-fidelity mockups from wireframes, incorporating colors, typography, spacing, and other visual design elements.
Drop-down Menu: Added interactive drop-down menus for smooth navigation and improved usability.
Components: Built reusable components such as buttons, cards, and icons to maintain design consistency across the project.
Auto Layout: Used auto layout to efficiently manage spacing, alignment, and positioning of elements, ensuring easy updates and modifications.
Responsive Designs: Designed flexible layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes using constraints and auto layout.
Prototyping: Linked frames and interactions to simulate real user flows and test navigation in a realistic environment.

How to Use:
Open the Figma file via the shared link or Figma app.
Explore Pages for Wireframes, Components, and Prototype views.
Use Prototype Mode to interact with drop-down menus and navigate through the app/website.
Inspect and reuse components to maintain a consistent design system.

I learnt how to plan the interaces effectivetly using wireframe before making the detailed designs. I doubted the importance of wireframing anad later realised that wireframing helps in conrmeplating the future designs for auto layout for scalable designs. I gained practical eperience in reponsive designing and interactive prototyping both in figma and codoing with HTML.
While starting with wireframing was extremely helpful. It allowed me to plan the layout and hierarchy of the interface without getting distracted by colors or styling. Initially, I faced challenges deciding the placement of navigation menus and content blocks, but wireframes helped me experiment quickly and find a user-friendly structure.

When moving to high-fidelity designs, creating components and using auto layout ensured consistency and efficiency. The drop-down menu initially didn’t behave as expected in the prototype, but by carefully linking overlays and frames, I was able to make it interactive. Designing for responsive layouts was challenging because some elements didn’t scale correctly at first. Using Figma’s constraints and auto layout features helped me solve these issues, creating flexible designs suitable for multiple devices.

Finally, prototyping allowed me to simulate user flow and see my design in action. It revealed areas that needed better alignment and navigation improvements, reinforcing the importance of user-centered design.
Overall, this project strengthened my practical Figma skills, taught me the value of planning with wireframes, and gave me hands-on experience in building designs that are both visually appealing and functionally intuitive.
