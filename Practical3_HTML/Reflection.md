# Introduction
Creating my student portfolio using HTML and CSS was a great learning experience for me. It was my first step into designing something that represents who I am as a student and what I have learned so far. The idea was to build a simple but well-organized webpage that showcases my details, projects, and skills in a neat and creative way.
At first, I started by planning how I wanted my portfolio to look. I used HTML to create the basic structure, adding sections like my introduction, education, skills, and contact information. After that, I used CSS to style everything — choosing colors, fonts, and layouts that matched my personality. It was fun experimenting with different styles and seeing how even small changes could make a big difference in the overall look.
# Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was with alignment and spacing. Some sections didn’t look balanced on the page, and the text sometimes overlapped with the images. Another issue was making the website responsive, so that it could adjust properly on different screen sizes like mobile or tablet. At first, my layout looked fine on a laptop but was messy on a smaller screen. To fix these issues, I learned and applied CSS Flexbox to arrange items neatly and maintain consistent spacing. I also explored media queries, which helped me adjust the design for different devices. Watching tutorials and experimenting with code really helped me understand how CSS works in real-life projects. Slowly, I managed to make the site more organized and user-friendly

# Conclusion
Overall, making this portfolio taught me much more than just HTML and CSS. It showed me how patience, creativity, and problem-solving go hand in hand in web development. Even though I faced a few difficulties, solving them helped me grow more confident in my skills. I’m proud of how my portfolio turned out simple, clean, and a true reflection of my learning journey.
