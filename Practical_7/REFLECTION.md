# Introduction
- Reflection on Learning DOM Manipulation
Working on the DOM manipulation project was both engaging and insightful. The exercise helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements to change content, styles, and structure. Through this code, I learned how to access and modify different parts of webpage using methods such as `getElementById()`and`getElementsByClassName()`. It was fascinating to see how a few lines of JavaScript could completely alter the behavior and look of a webpage.

One of the key takeaways was learning how to respond to user actions using event listeners. For example, the buttons in the code allowed me to change the title, add new elements, and remove existing ones, making the page interactive. This taught me the practical importance of the Document Object Model (DOM) as a bridge between HTML structure and JavaScript functionality. I also learned how to dynamically create and style elements using `createElement()` and `classList.add()`.
- Challenges And Resolution
A challenge I faced was understanding how parent and child relationships work within the DOM. At first, I was unsure how to properly remove only specific elements without affecting others. Through trial and error, I learned to use properties like `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, and `parentElement` effectively. Debugging through the browser console also helped me visualize the hierarchy of HTML elements and better understand how JavaScript traverses them.

# Conclusion
Overall, this activity strengthened my grasp of DOM manipulation and event handling. It gave me confidence to build more interactive and user-friendly webpages in the future. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized the potential of making static pages dynamic and engaging. This exercise has laid a strong foundation for more advanced web development topics like animations, form validations, and responsive design.
