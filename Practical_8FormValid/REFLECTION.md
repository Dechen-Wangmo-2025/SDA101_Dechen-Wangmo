# Introduction
Creating a form validation and palindrome checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was an exciting and insightful project for me. It helped me understand how front-end technologies work together to make web pages not only look good but also behave intelligently.

At the start, I designed the form layout using HTML to create input fields, buttons, and labels for user interaction. Then, I used CSS to style the page — adjusting colors, spacing, and hover effects to make the form visually appealing. After setting up the design, I moved on to JavaScript, which brought the real functionality to life. I used hovering in this practice just like how I did in figma practicals.

- Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I faced was making sure the form validation worked correctly in real time. At first, the validation messages didn’t appear as expected or disappeared too early. Another issue was handling special characters and spaces in the palindrome checker, which caused incorrect results.
So I learned how to use event listeners like onblur and onsubmit properly. I also used if-else conditions and logical operators to control when the validation messages should appear or disappear. For the palindrome logic, I added string cleaning methods to remove spaces and special characters before checking for equality. Testing the program step by step in the browser console helped me identify and solve errors effectively.

# Conclusion
Overall, this project helped me understand how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work together to create interactive and user-friendly web pages. I learned that even small programs can involve logical thinking and attention to detail. Although I faced several issues during development, solving them through research and trial-and-error improved my confidence in coding. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also made me appreciate the importance of testing, debugging, and designing with the user in mind.
