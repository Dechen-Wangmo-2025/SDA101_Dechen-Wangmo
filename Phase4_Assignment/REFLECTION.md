This project was created using Figma to design [a website/app/user interface]. The goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly interface with a focus on visual hierarchy, color schemes, typography, and usability. Figma was chosen for its collaborative features, easy prototyping, and vector-based design tools.

# Features Implemented:

- High-fidelity mockups with consistent color schemes and typography

- Interactive prototypes for user flow demonstration

- Component-based design for reusable elements (buttons, icons,etc)

- Responsive layout considerations for multiple screen sizes

# Project Structure:
Pages: Separate pages for Wireframes, UI Design, and Prototype
Components: Buttons, Input Fields, Navigation Bar, Cards
Frames: Individual screens or sections for better organization
Assets: Icons, images, and illustrations used in the design

# Usage:
Open the Figma file via the shared link or Figma desktop app.
Navigate through pages and frames to explore the design.
Use the Prototype mode to simulate user interactions.
Review Components for reusability and design consistency.

# Learning Outcomes:
Gained experience in designing clean and intuitive interfaces.
Learned to use components, auto-layout, and prototyping efficiently.
Developed an understanding of visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography.

Working on this project in Figma was a highly valuable experience. Initially, I faced challenges in aligning components consistently and maintaining a uniform color palette across all screens. I overcame this by creating style guides and reusable components, which made the design more organized and consistent.

Another challenge was designing responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. By experimenting with Figmaâ€™s auto-layout and constraints, I was able to create flexible designs that scale properly.

The prototyping phase taught me the importance of user flow and interaction design. Linking frames and testing the navigation helped me understand how users would experience the interface in real life.

Overall, this project enhanced my skills in UI/UX design, prototyping, and visual communication. Figma proved to be a powerful tool for both individual and collaborative design work. The hands-on practice strengthened my understanding of design principles, usability, and interface consistency, which are essential for professional UI/UX design.
